TEST BASE CASE, any mode can be used since we only use one client to test

run netserverinit(), test with good and bad host
run netserverinit(), test with good and bad file mode

run netopen(), these cases should return error
-->read on write only file
-->write on read only file

rdwr on rdwr file, this case should work
-->call netread(), should read nbytes into buffer
	-->call netread on bad fd, should return error
-->call netwrite(), should write nbytes of buffer into file
	-->call netwrite on bad fd, should return error

run netclose()
-->test on current file, should work
-->test on bad fd, should return error


TEST EXTENSION A:

Make three clients, one in transaction, on in exclusive, one in unrestricted

1.	Open a file in transaction mode. When we try to open the same file in any other mode,
	should return error
2. 	Open a file in any mode other than transaction mode. When we try to open the same file
	in transaction mode, should return error
3.	Open a file in exclusive mode with write privileges. 
	-->Any other open wanting write privilege on the same file should return error
	-->Ay other open wanting read-only privilege should work
4.	Open a file in unrestricted mode with write privileges. When we try to open the same
	file with exclusive mode:
	-->Any other unrestricted opens of the same file should work
	-->Any other open wanting read-only privilege in exclusive mode on the same file
	   should work
	-->Any other open wanting write privilege on the same file in exclusive mode
	   should return error

	   
Other Tests/Results (Test Cases above still apply):
1.	Unless a file is open in transaction mode, any read-only request in any mode 
	should work.
2.	If a file is open in exclusive mode but does not have write privilege, any request
	in unrestricted mode should work. Otherwise, only read-only requests in exclusive and
	unrestricted mode should work, any other should return error
