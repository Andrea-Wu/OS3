##WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CREAT bob.txt
#note that fuse never intercepts "create" function -> should it?
    #however, it does intercept SOEMTHING 
#the file descriptor that creat return is "3"
#on successive runs of "./a.out" the fd count resets.....i think it should be saved.

#when I ls in  "/tmp/fuse" nothing displays....
